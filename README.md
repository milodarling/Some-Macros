Some Macros
=============

Here are some macros and stuff I use in my projects. So far, there's DebugLog, a beautiful macro for NSLogging stuff with a prefix with ease.

I'm working on Specifiers, a header for creating Specifiers in the runtime (instead of plists) using just macros. It supports creating most specifiers, and a cool twitter PSButtonCell. It's kind of hacky and gross right now, so make sure you understand it before you use it.
